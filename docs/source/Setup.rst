Start Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to create your own building style from scratch, it's a very easy process!
With the addon enabled, simple click on either **Starting Object** or **Example Object** to begin.


The **Starting object** will create a simple cube and add the Auto-Building modifier on it as well as all the necessary Materials.

The **Example object** will be a bit more complexe. I will comes already setup with simple geometries for you to have a quick start in the modeling process.

You can also start the process by grabbing a preset model from the Asset Browser. You can then manually transfer the geometry node modifier and ID materials to the object you want to work on. Or modify the asset you just imported to your own taste.
