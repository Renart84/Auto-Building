Extra
========

Foundation
------------
If there is a bottom face on your building,it will extrude it down to create a volume under the buiding. Useful if the floor is not flat.

**Foundation extrusion**: Distance of extrusion. Use 0 if you don't want extrusion.

**Foundation material**: Material to use on the foundation.


Support
--------
**Support Collection**: If the bottom face of your building is located above the building origin (if there is an overhang) a support from this collection will appear.

**Fit Edges**: Will stretch the support object to match the size of the edge.

**Support Pillar subdivision**: If Fit Edge is off, will add more pillars.

Facade Dressing
---------------
**Facade dressing collection**: Collection of object to scatter on the walls of your building.

**Minimum distance**: Distance between object. The smaller the more object will be scattered.

**Seed**: Randomize the objects.

**Minimum/Maximum height position**: Use these settings to constraint the facade objects between a specific heights. Aka if you don't want your objects to spawn too close to the ground of the roof.
