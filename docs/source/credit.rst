This Geometry Node system uses some of the Node Groups made by awesome people, way better than me. 
If you're curious to make your own system please do not hesitate to aquire their node groups as they will save you so much time.

He is probably the best person to look at if you want to learn Geometry Node yourself. He proposes some awesome videos on Youtube (which I learnt a tone from) but also has a great online class if you want to go more in depth. 
His Erindale Toolkit will give you access to a lot of very useful node groups

His toolpack contain a lot of powerful nodes. I'm specially using his Tesselate solution to allow the deformation of the objects on the face. It's someone always innovating with Geoemtry Node and you should follow his work.
